# Distance finder graphical plot

Initially, I wanted to build a Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) buoy which would operate in shallow water - to detect fish - so that I could convinced a special someone to swim in the sea with me. Anyway, after I read a textbook on acoustics I decided the problem was a bit more involved that I would've liked. Instead I decided to make a closer ranging system, in air, which would indicate where nearby object are in a two-dimensional space. I decided to use R because I wanted more experience with it's syntax.
